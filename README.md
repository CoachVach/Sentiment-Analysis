# Sentiment-Analysis

Installation: Setup - Install necessary libraries (if not installed):
pip install nltk pandas scikit-learn

Summary: This project focuses on sentiment analysis within the field of natural language processing (NLP). Using Python libraries like NLTK and Scikit-learn, the project uses the movie_reviews dataset to build a model that can classify movie reviews as positive or negative. The workflow involves loading and preprocessing text data and training a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier. After training, the model's performance is evaluated through accuracy and classification metrics. This project seeks to illustrate practical uses of sentiment analysis in text data.
